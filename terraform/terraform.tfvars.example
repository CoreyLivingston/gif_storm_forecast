# Example Terraform variables configuration for secure GIF Storm Forecast deployment
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and customize the values

# S3 bucket name (optional - will be auto-generated if not provided)
# The bucket will be configured as private with no public access
# bucket_name = "my-gif-storm-forecast-bucket"

# AWS region for secure infrastructure deployment
aws_region = "us-east-1"

# Environment name for tagging and resource naming
environment = "dev"

# Project name for resource naming and tagging
project_name = "gif-storm-forecast"

# SECURITY NOTE: CloudFront CDN is now MANDATORY for all deployments
# - Provides HTTPS-only access (HTTP requests are redirected to HTTPS)
# - Enables secure Origin Access Control (OAC) to private S3 bucket
# - Blocks all direct public access to S3 bucket
# - CloudFront deployment takes 15+ minutes but ensures security compliance

# Example configurations for different secure environments:

# Development environment (secure with mandatory CloudFront)
# environment = "dev"
# aws_region = "us-east-1"

# Staging environment (secure with mandatory CloudFront)
# environment = "staging"
# aws_region = "us-west-2"

# Production environment (secure with mandatory CloudFront)
# environment = "prod"
# aws_region = "us-east-1"
# bucket_name = "gif-storm-forecast-prod-static-site"
