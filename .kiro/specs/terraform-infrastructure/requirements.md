# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds Terraform infrastructure-as-code to deploy the GIF Storm Forecast application as a secure static website on AWS. The infrastructure will automate the creation of a private S3 bucket for content storage and a mandatory CloudFront distribution for secure HTTPS content delivery. The solution prioritizes security best practices by eliminating public S3 access and enforcing HTTPS-only access through CloudFront with Origin Access Control (OAC).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy the GIF Storm Forecast application using Terraform, so that I can automate infrastructure provisioning and ensure consistent deployments across environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `terraform apply` THEN the system SHALL create all necessary AWS resources for static website hosting
2. WHEN the infrastructure is created THEN the system SHALL output the website URL for accessing the deployed application
3. WHEN I run `terraform destroy` THEN the system SHALL cleanly remove all created resources without leaving orphaned components
4. WHEN I modify Terraform configuration THEN the system SHALL support incremental updates without breaking existing functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the S3 bucket configured as a private content repository, so that website content is stored securely and only accessible through CloudFront.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the S3 bucket is created THEN the system SHALL keep the bucket private with no public access
2. WHEN the bucket is configured THEN the system SHALL block all public access settings
3. WHEN content is stored THEN the system SHALL only allow access through CloudFront Origin Access Control
4. WHEN the bucket is created THEN the system SHALL disable static website hosting features

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want secure Origin Access Control (OAC) configured, so that CloudFront can access S3 content while preventing any direct public access to the bucket.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Origin Access Control is configured THEN the system SHALL create an OAC identity for CloudFront
2. WHEN bucket permissions are set THEN the system SHALL only allow access from the CloudFront distribution
3. WHEN security is configured THEN the system SHALL block all public access to the S3 bucket
4. WHEN the bucket is created THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate resource tags for cost tracking and management

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want cost-optimized infrastructure configuration, so that the hosting costs remain minimal while providing reliable service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the S3 bucket is created THEN the system SHALL use Standard storage class for frequently accessed content
2. WHEN lifecycle policies are configured THEN the system SHALL transition older objects to cheaper storage classes if applicable
3. WHEN the infrastructure is deployed THEN the system SHALL minimize data transfer costs through efficient configuration
4. WHEN resources are tagged THEN the system SHALL include cost allocation tags for budget tracking

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want mandatory CloudFront CDN with HTTPS enforcement, so that the website is always served securely with optimal performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the infrastructure is deployed THEN the system SHALL always create a CloudFront distribution
2. WHEN CloudFront is configured THEN the system SHALL enforce HTTPS-only access by redirecting HTTP to HTTPS
3. WHEN CDN is deployed THEN the system SHALL use cost-effective price class settings
4. WHEN the distribution is created THEN the system SHALL configure Origin Access Control to access the private S3 bucket

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configurable Terraform variables, so that I can customize the deployment for different environments while maintaining security standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide a bucket name variable THEN the system SHALL use it for creating the private S3 bucket
2. WHEN I specify AWS region THEN the system SHALL deploy resources in the specified region
3. WHEN I configure environment tags THEN the system SHALL apply them to all created resources
4. WHEN variables are processed THEN the system SHALL remove the CloudFront enable/disable option since it's now mandatory

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear Terraform outputs focused on the secure CloudFront endpoint, so that I can easily access the deployed website and integrate with other systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Terraform completes successfully THEN the system SHALL output the HTTPS CloudFront URL as the primary website endpoint
2. WHEN the distribution is created THEN the system SHALL output the CloudFront distribution domain name and ID
3. WHEN resources are created THEN the system SHALL output the S3 bucket name for content upload reference
4. WHEN the deployment finishes THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for uploading content to the private S3 bucket

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want CloudFront Origin Access Control properly configured, so that S3 content is only accessible through the CDN and never directly from the internet.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Origin Access Control is created THEN the system SHALL generate a unique OAC identity for the CloudFront distribution
2. WHEN the S3 bucket policy is configured THEN the system SHALL only allow access from the specific CloudFront OAC identity
3. WHEN the CloudFront distribution is configured THEN the system SHALL use the OAC identity to access S3 content
4. WHEN security is validated THEN the system SHALL ensure no direct S3 access is possible from the internet

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper Terraform state management configuration, so that I can safely manage infrastructure changes in team environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Terraform configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL include backend configuration options
2. WHEN state management is configured THEN the system SHALL support remote state storage
3. WHEN multiple developers work on the project THEN the system SHALL prevent state conflicts through proper locking
4. WHEN backend is configured THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation for setup
