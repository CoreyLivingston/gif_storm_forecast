# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds Terraform infrastructure-as-code to deploy the GIF Storm Forecast application as a cost-effective static website on AWS. The infrastructure will automate the creation of S3 bucket for static website hosting, configure proper permissions, and optionally include CloudFront CDN for improved performance and security. The solution prioritizes cost optimization while maintaining reliability and ease of deployment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy the GIF Storm Forecast application using Terraform, so that I can automate infrastructure provisioning and ensure consistent deployments across environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `terraform apply` THEN the system SHALL create all necessary AWS resources for static website hosting
2. WHEN the infrastructure is created THEN the system SHALL output the website URL for accessing the deployed application
3. WHEN I run `terraform destroy` THEN the system SHALL cleanly remove all created resources without leaving orphaned components
4. WHEN I modify Terraform configuration THEN the system SHALL support incremental updates without breaking existing functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the S3 bucket configured for static website hosting, so that the application can be accessed via a web browser with proper index document handling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the S3 bucket is created THEN the system SHALL enable static website hosting with index.html as the index document
2. WHEN a user accesses the root URL THEN the system SHALL serve the index.html file automatically
3. WHEN the bucket is configured THEN the system SHALL allow public read access for website content
4. WHEN static website hosting is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide a website endpoint URL

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper IAM policies and bucket permissions configured, so that the website content is publicly accessible while maintaining security best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the bucket policy is applied THEN the system SHALL allow public read access to all objects in the bucket
2. WHEN public access is configured THEN the system SHALL disable unnecessary public access block settings for website hosting
3. WHEN permissions are set THEN the system SHALL follow AWS security best practices for static website hosting
4. WHEN the bucket is created THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate resource tags for cost tracking and management

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want cost-optimized infrastructure configuration, so that the hosting costs remain minimal while providing reliable service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the S3 bucket is created THEN the system SHALL use Standard storage class for frequently accessed content
2. WHEN lifecycle policies are configured THEN the system SHALL transition older objects to cheaper storage classes if applicable
3. WHEN the infrastructure is deployed THEN the system SHALL minimize data transfer costs through efficient configuration
4. WHEN resources are tagged THEN the system SHALL include cost allocation tags for budget tracking

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optional CloudFront CDN integration, so that I can improve website performance and add HTTPS support when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CloudFront is enabled THEN the system SHALL create a distribution pointing to the S3 website endpoint
2. WHEN CloudFront is configured THEN the system SHALL provide HTTPS access to the website
3. WHEN CDN is deployed THEN the system SHALL use cost-effective price class settings
4. WHEN CloudFront is enabled THEN the system SHALL output both S3 and CloudFront URLs

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configurable Terraform variables, so that I can customize the deployment for different environments and use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide a bucket name variable THEN the system SHALL use it for creating the S3 bucket
2. WHEN I specify AWS region THEN the system SHALL deploy resources in the specified region
3. WHEN I configure environment tags THEN the system SHALL apply them to all created resources
4. WHEN I enable/disable CloudFront THEN the system SHALL conditionally create or skip CDN resources

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear Terraform outputs, so that I can easily access the deployed website and integrate with other systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Terraform completes successfully THEN the system SHALL output the S3 website endpoint URL
2. WHEN CloudFront is enabled THEN the system SHALL output the CloudFront distribution domain name
3. WHEN resources are created THEN the system SHALL output the S3 bucket name for reference
4. WHEN the deployment finishes THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for uploading content

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper Terraform state management configuration, so that I can safely manage infrastructure changes in team environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Terraform configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL include backend configuration options
2. WHEN state management is configured THEN the system SHALL support remote state storage
3. WHEN multiple developers work on the project THEN the system SHALL prevent state conflicts through proper locking
4. WHEN backend is configured THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation for setup
